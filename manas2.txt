00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,500
"good" is just what people
call people who help them.

183
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,060
I can't count how many lives I've taken.

184
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,040
And not just soldiers in battle.

185
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Civilians.

186
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:15,555
Even kids.

187
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,420
Now I've chosen to betray the
island where I was born and raised.

188
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,400
I've killed my own comrades.

189
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,940
If I'm "good," then that word is useless.

190
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,220
As a child, I made a promise to Eren

191
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,900
that one day we would all get to
explore this vast unknown world together.

192
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,320
I wanted to think I could keep it.

193
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,380
Learning what it was really like out
here must have been a painful lesson.

194
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:43,195
Yeah.

195
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,940
The world we'd spend our lives
dreaming of wasn't what we got.

196
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,096
But...

197
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,660
Even so,

198
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,260
a part of me still hope that there's
something more beyond the walls,

199
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:06,640
waiting to be found.

200
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,690
It's so quiet here.

201
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,530
It would appear the residents
of Odiha have already fled south.

202
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,110
All the ships set sail before we arrived.

203
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,930
Right. So then...

204
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,910
It comes down to your team.

205
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,470
Yes. The Azumabito clan will get
the flying boat airborne at any cost.

206
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,670
We've got to hurry! Get the cover!

207
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,270
Shit! The explosives are in the way!

208
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,690
Cut them off and toss them.

209
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,250
Wait. We might be able
to use these for something.

210
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,630
Load them up once the cover is off.

211
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:54,640
[FLACO scream] There's no way!

212
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,730
Commander Magath! My family!

213
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,070
Everyone back home in Liberio!

214
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,770
They can't all be gone!

215
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:08,410
By now, most of the Marleyan continent
has been flattened by the rumbling.

216
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,530
Then what are we doing? And why?

217
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,570
Who's left to save? Everybody is dead!

218
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,890
I'm sorry.

219
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I wish I knew.

220
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,430
Annie.

221
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,910
You still don't have much
experience with the newer ODM gear.

222
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,440
This would be a good
time to test out your rig.

223
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,250
You can go practice with Reiner.
Get a feel for it.

224
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,810
Why would I?

225
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,456
Uh... If there's a chance we have
a duty to take it, it'll be tough.

226
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,230
But we still... Look, I told you on
the way over that I was done fighting.

227
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,790
So you're not going to be
joining us on the flying boat?

228
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,850
Sorry, but no.

229
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:03,390
This whole "saving humanity" idea...
I honestly just... don't understand it.

230
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,904
As Eldians and Marley, we
were caged and tortured from

231
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:11,130
birth by the "humanity"
you're so desperate to save.

232
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,310
That was the world I knew.

233
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,210
But the cage protected us, too.

234
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,490
And Eren trampled it flat.

235
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,250
If we stop the rumbling, we Eldians
will stand alone, against everyone.

236
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,150
I truly am sorry.

237
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,610
These people are giving all they have
for a chance to save their homelands.

238
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,770
And I feel for them.

239
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,670
But I'm done.

240
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,870
I don't have it in me to keep fighting.

241
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,250
If this is the end of it all.

242
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,050
I want to spend it... in peace.

246
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,360
So when did this start?

When did what start?

00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:02,600
Right. I get it.

Get what?

It's okay.

Armin will be coming
with us on the flying boat.

254
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,240
We're going to track down Eren.

255
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:22,555
I know that.

256
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,140
When you find him, what
do you expect to happen?

257
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,480
If saving the world means killing
Eren, will you have the will to do it?

258
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,660
I won't kill him.

259
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,620
Eren is strayed too far from home.

260
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,220
All I'm doing... is bringing him back.

261
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:47,860
Hey, before you go...
What happened to your old scarf?

262
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,660
I've still got it.

don't get to forget about me.

[ARMIN gasps] [LEVI] Moving on.

268
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,466
Our bearded lady's
third elbow is healing up,

269
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,600
and it seems like she
survived her infection.

270
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,460
I'm going to make her
tell us where Eren is going.

271
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,860
If the Allied nations combine their
fleets to attack the island of Paradis...

272
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:28,200
They'll be assembling
here, at Karifa Naval Port.

273
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,882
After the raid on Liberio,
we'll allow a month for their

274
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:34,760
forces to gather before we
bring you in contact with Zeke.

275
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,886
With him, you'll be able
to use the power of the.

276
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,500
Founding Titan, and
activate a limited rumbling.

277
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,167
The outer wall around
Shiganshina holds several

278
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:47,200
hundred Titans, easily
enough to crush the whole fleet.

279
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,360
And there's nothing else
we need to worry about?

280
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,400
Will destroying their navies really
guarantee Paradis a few decades of peace?

281
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,060
Losing a fleet would be a death
blow to any nation's finances.

282
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,440
As long as we hid all the major powers,
nobody will have the means to hit us back.

283
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,311
But in the worst case,
this fortress in the.

284
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:09,340
Southern Mountains
could give us some trouble.

285
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,860
The airship research base there
may be a worthwhile secondary target.

286
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,930
If I had to guess, that's where
Eren will be heading next.

287
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,070
The air base at Fort Salta.

288
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,905
Makes sense.
He would want to get rid of any weapon that

289
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:31,730
could pose even the slightest
threat to the Founding Titan.

290
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,821
First he'll wipe out the United Fleet at
Karifa,

291
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,590
and then the airships at Fort Salta.

292
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,550
Didn't feel like getting
any more bones broken.

293
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,730
I want you all to do something for me.

Acknowledge the truth.

295
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,510
Zeke lost his battle, but he
was fighting for the right cause.

296
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,713
The Eldian Empire brought
2,000 years of misery to the

297
00:20:57,737 --> 00:21:01,250
world, and the euthanization
plan was the way to fix it.

298
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,290
Surely you're able to see that by now.

299
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,570
Yeah, I can't deny it.

300
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,047
I thought I could show Eren a
better way, but I was powerless.

301
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:16,990

hope, or a path forward.

Please take the two of them with you.

Even if the kids stay on the ship,
they won't be out of harm's way.

308
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,970
But it's still safer than the flying boat.

309
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,510
Of course, I have no objection to that.

310
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,230
But do you believe they'll
be willing to accept it?

311
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,290
I can keep them in their cabin.

312
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,460
Just make sure they stay
there until we've gotten airborne.

313
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,930
And what about you?

314
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,130
I still have a debt to pay
to my fallen comrades.

It's fine, Annie.

This isn't your war.

You weren't in it for

You've already done more
than anyone could ask of you.

of you to go through with the mission.

feels presumptuous.

Yeah, but I managed to talk
myself out of killing you. Barely.

335

[Gasp] Well done. I commend your restraint.

Like what?

343
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,460
Now I'm worried.
This may not work without her.

344
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,720
It'll be hard, but she's been
through more than enough.

I want Annie to just keep being Annie.

Are you two sure you want to join us?

348
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:32,860
If we do stop the rumbling, our lives
as Eldians won't be getting any easier.

349
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,800
We understand that.

350
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,280
But even so, we have a mission to finish.

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,020
General Magath's last order to
us was clear, and we'll carry it out.

352
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,380
It's time to work together
and do what must be done.

353
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:51,780
Pieck, I- I hope someday you'll
let me

354
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:54,160
feel Cart Titan's body heat under
me as we ride over the...

355
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:57,280
Quit that. Of all the times to be creepy.

356
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,940
You know the Titans are never going to
love you back, three eyes. Quit pushing it.

357
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,240
I think I'll win her over yet.

358
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,260
Levi, do you think they're
all watching over us?

359
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,780
The comrades we've lost...

360
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,980
Do you think they'd be proud
of what we're doing here?

361
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,540
That's enough of that talk.
You're sounding just like him.

362
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,280
Good. Begin fueling and keep up the pace!

363
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Roger that, sir!

364
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,260
We made it. We outran the rumbling.

365
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
This could still work.

[Gasps]

367
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Flock!

368
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,336
Don't tell me... Did he let the
ship drag him all the way here?

369
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Hange!

370
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,460

Don't give up!

It'll fly if we can get these holes sealed.

[Gasp] Grab the welding tools!

376
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,880
How long's it gonna take?

377
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,840
Patching it with tin will be the
fastest way. An hour should be just...

378
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,710
We haven't got an hour.

379
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,690
No, no, no!

380
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,130
It's here.

381
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,650
The rumbling is here.

Don't...

Please...

We're here, Flock.

It's true, Flock.
We can't protect them all.

But still...

396
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,200
We have no choice but to try.

397
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,360
And even if we fail today...

398
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,943
Maybe someday...

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,000
Stop! Why are you doing this?

00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:04,360

00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah.

405
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,800
I can stay here, buy you some time.

406
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,060
No, that won't work.
We're gonna need you against Eren.

407
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
You're our fallback.

408
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:27,920
Go. I can cover the rear.

409
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,160
You think that's any better?

410
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,520
If we're going to stand a chance, we
can't use any of our Titan power yet.

411
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,000
We wouldn't be facing this
situation if it weren't for me.

There's one quality this
post requires above all else.

An uncompromising desire
to understand our world.

Hange died to get this thing flying,
with humanity's last hope on board.

So we're gonna get to
that base, whatever it takes.

I swear it.

477
00:35:11,116 --> 00:35:14,206
In return, you all have
to stop the rumbling.

478
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,113
Please promise me that.

479
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:20,600
Yeah. We will.

00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:22,423
Thank you.

481
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:25,866
Okay.

482
00:35:26,966 --> 00:35:28,306
Let's lay out the plan.

483
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:34,240
Based on what you saw, does the Founding
Titan's body look something like this?

484
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,880
Yeah.
Though what I saw wasn't really that much.

485
00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:43,093
It's an ugly pile of bones crawling
along on its belly, like some gigantic bug.

486
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,660
If it works like most Titans, Eren is
controlling it from the nape of its neck.

487
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:51,095
But the Warhammer's power is in play here.
That changes the game.

488
00:35:51,706 --> 00:35:52,706
Exactly.

489
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:55,923
We don't know which
part of the body he's in.

490
00:35:56,761 --> 00:36:01,600
But we don't need to land a precise hit.
We've got a weapon that can annihilate it.

491
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:05,700
The same weapon that laid waste
to the port at Liberio in an instant.

492
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:08,606
We can drop the Colossal Titan on him.

493
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,880
We could. It's a guaranteed
way to destroy the Founder.

494
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:16,917
[MIKASA gasps]

495
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,860
But before that, I still
want to try to talk things out.

496
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,280
If we can't convince Eren to stop the
Rumbling himself, I'll be our last resort.

497
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,500
Coming up with the last
resort first isn't a bad idea.

498
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,440
But Zeke holds the Founder's power.
Eren controlling it through him.

499
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:40,113
We don't need to blow his whole body away.
Killing Zeke should end the Rumbling.

500
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,440
You're right. It might work.

501
00:36:44,623 --> 00:36:47,393
No way to be sure, but
that was Hange's theory.

502
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:50,766
Still doesn't help unless
we figure out where Zeke is.

503
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,000
Easy enough problem to solve.
We dig into that

504
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:58,223
bone heap and force
the hairy bastard out.

506
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:09,623
We'll find him. And I'll cut him down.

507
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:16,000
With your help. Are we agreed?

508
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:21,570
Got it, Captain. I'm with you.

509
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:25,990
We had to kill so many of our friends
just to get this thing into the sky.

510
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,529
If we back down, we'll have
butchered our own people in vain.

511
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,970
All of this is to stop the Rumbling.
I'll do whatever it takes.

512
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,110
Me too.

513
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,640
Reiner, I had to shoot
Samuel and Daz at the port.

514
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,150
I carved up people I've
known since we were cadets.

515
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,373
They died cursing my
name, calling me a traitor,

516
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,810
while I told myself I
was saving the world.

517
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,579
Was it the same for your team?
You, Bertholdt,

518
00:38:01,603 --> 00:38:04,590
and Annie. Is this what it felt like?

519
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:10,410
Yeah. I know my sins are beyond redemption.

520
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:15,446
I doubt I'll ever forgive myself, even
if we save what's left of humanity.

521
00:38:24,255 --> 00:38:29,800
Still, we've gotta try.
Even knowing it'll never be enough.

522
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:38,103
I needed to hear that.
Thank you. It won't make up for

523
00:38:38,127 --> 00:38:42,110
all we've done.
But still, we gotta do what we can.

524
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:50,480
Reiner, I shouldn't have judged you.
I'm sorry.

[REINER gasps]

526
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,666
[JEAN] I became a murderer to
protect the lives of other people,

527
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,250
just like you. I can't pretend
your sins are greater than my own.

528
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:08,396
You know, Eren told me something
similar just before the Liberio raid.

529
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:16,636
Right now, I feel like I might have
some idea what's going on in his mind.

530
00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:20,989
Do you think he might be
hoping we can beat him?

00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,870
What do you mean by that?

533
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,309
Not sure.
It's a feeling I can't really explain.

534
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:33,156
Actually, there's one
thing I still don't get.

535
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:40,200
Eren has the power of the Founder.
He can control all Eldians and all Titans.

536
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:45,623
He should be able to keep us from
using our Titan powers. But he hasn't.

537
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:51,410
Are you trying to say that Eren has
been giving us free reign this whole time?

538
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:54,400
That's right. He's letting us do all this.

539
00:39:55,316 --> 00:40:00,010
It's like he wants to find out how we're
going to respond to what he's done.

540
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:04,430
Why would he? He's gotta know
there's a chance we'll stop the rumbling.

541
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:09,496
That's just it. If I were in his place,

542
00:40:09,903 --> 00:40:14,370
if all that blood was on my
hands, I couldn't bear it.

543
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:19,210
I think I'd want somebody to
take the Founder's power from me.

544
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:22,516
If nobody could, then I'd want somebody

545
00:40:25,218 --> 00:40:26,218
to end it.

546
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:28,213

We've won, okay? It's over!
Paradis is safe now!

The world has seen
the terror of the rumbling!

If anyone ever attacks the island
again, it won't be for centuries!

557
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:02,909
We'll be able to negotiate a non-aggression
treaty with the other countries!

558
00:41:03,513 --> 00:41:08,303
You never need to kill anyone again, Eren!
We can go home and live our lives in peace!

559
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,856
We understand that we screwed up!
We were wrong to

560
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,490
push you this far, but you
don't have to keep going!

561
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,809
Eren...

562
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,880
Eren! We'll figure out a way
to handle things from here!

Please, stop this bloodbath and let us try

to make the best of
what's left of the world!

00:41:30,716 --> 00:41:34,680
Eren!
I hated you for what happened to Sasha!

567
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:38,450
But I know you were
hurting as much as any of us!

568

I could have seen it back then
if I'd put myself in your shoes!

Eren... I want to help you
carry the burden of your sins.

00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:56,669
We all do.
Because there are sins as well.

We're here. Don't push us away!

You heard your friends, Eren.
If they insist, I'll

one good kick in the ass.

us do all the talking or what?

And the future of the island of Paradis
will not be left to the whims of fate.

Why won't you listen to us?
Do you not trust us to handle this?

00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,790
Wait, Eren! Why are you still
letting us use the Titan powers?

We're here for you now,
so stop running away! Eren!

00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:34,734
I will hold freedom in my
hands by taking it from this world.

593

But from you, I will take nothing.

oppose me and defend the

am free to move forward.

Our convictions can never be
reconciled, and our wills will not bend.

There is only one way for
this to be resolved. Fight!

598

But then.

599
00:44:13,396 --> 00:44:18,870
Then why do this? If talking
won't help, then why bring us here?

600
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:24,347
I brought you here to say
that there is nothing to say.

me from breathing, and you are free to try.

Well, it looks like I had it right.

605
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,466
Then there's really no other way?

606
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:02,900
Guess it's safe to say we're done
negotiating. So, Commander, what's next?

607
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:14,940
Where is this ship headed?

We'll be on course for Hizuru
these next several days.

I have faith that Lady Mikasa and her
comrades will be able to stop the rumbling.

610
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:29,287
However, I fear we'll learn my country
is nonetheless in a state of collapse.

Gonna be hard to find anything
to eat but fish for a while, huh?

I'm sure you'll find the
seafood in Hizuru is exquisite.

613
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,380
Glad to hear it. Oh, I forgot about birds.

614
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:50,129
It was thanks to me that
Zeke and Eren were united.

615
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:54,920
I could put every waking
moment toward atoning for

616
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,292
my part in the slaughter
and still die unredeemed.

617
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:04,923
So, if you could make that
choice again, what would you do?

618
00:46:04,947 --> 00:46:08,592
Leave the Eldians to their own
devices and watch Paradis die?

619
00:46:11,222 --> 00:46:13,880
It's useless to speak of
turning back the clock.

620
00:46:14,278 --> 00:46:17,992
Yet my regret will surely weigh
on me for as long as I live.

621
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,753
I can't rightly call myself a
friend to the Eldian people

622
00:46:21,777 --> 00:46:24,752
when I never truly acted in
the interest of their survival.

623
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:28,529
Instead, I forged an
alliance of convenience for

624
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,232
the financial and social
betterment of the Azumabito.

625
00:46:38,857 --> 00:46:42,872
I wonder why we so often fail
to see what matters till it's lost.

626
00:46:45,832 --> 00:46:50,352
Why we can't recognize the value in one
another beyond what benefits ourselves.

627
00:46:53,732 --> 00:46:57,152
You're right. We learn too late.

628
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,480
Annie, I... I had a dream.

629
00:47:06,062 --> 00:47:07,952
Did you? From Galliard?

630
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:11,952
No, it was from Zeke.
And it... was a memory.

631
00:47:12,242 --> 00:47:15,122
They told us back in training that
the female Titan can manifest the

632
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:18,392
abilities of the rest of the Nine by
taking in parts of their bodies, right?

633
00:47:18,899 --> 00:47:22,280
Yeah. The female is best
suited for that trick.

634
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,600
You wouldn't believe the stuff they fed me.

635
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:25,867
[BOTH gasp] [ANNIE] What of it?

636
00:47:25,892 --> 00:47:26,892
Just like we thought!

637
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,972
Then there might still
be something we can do!

638
00:47:28,997 --> 00:47:30,388
But how can we be sure it'll work?

639
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:33,292
Will you two shut up?
Go carry some coal or something!

640
00:47:37,012 --> 00:47:39,732
Did you say you had a vision
of one of Zeke's memories?

641
00:47:40,672 --> 00:47:45,072
That's right. I think it's because I became
a Titan by drinking his spinal fluid.

642
00:47:45,097 --> 00:47:48,872
And now Falco started manifesting
aspects of the Beast Titan!

643
00:47:50,182 --> 00:47:52,092
Okay. Keep talking.

644
00:47:53,052 --> 00:47:58,492
In the memory I see most clearly,
I'm flying. Up above the clouds.

645
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:04,092
And as I look down, somehow
it feels like I could do that too.

[ANNIE gasp]

647
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:21,872
That's Fort Salta on the Mesa, right?
Are there really airships there?

648
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:26,532
Couldn't say. But you bet everything
on a long-shot plan to steal one.

649
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:29,542
I guess we won't find
out if your gamble paid off

650
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:32,252
until we get to the end of the line.
Will we, Eldian?

651
00:48:36,342 --> 00:48:38,532
Careful how you talk to me, Marleyan.

652
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,832
That gamble is the only reason
you're not a stain in a foot-shaped crater.

653
00:48:43,762 --> 00:48:47,732
If it doesn't pay off, your family
dies in the rumbling with the rest of us.

654
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:51,325
If you betray us, you die
here of a gunshot wound.

655
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:54,392
But if the plan works,
you all see another day.

656
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:57,422
I don't give a damn if
the odds are against us.

657
00:48:57,446 --> 00:48:59,892
We're all gonna come
out of this thing alive.

They're a tough couple
of kids, and they've

got Reina and Colt
there to look after them.

Right now they're trapped on that
island with the devils themselves!

toss that thing out the window.

Hold on. They're not evacuating. The
airships are heading towards the Titans!

00:50:39,532 --> 00:50:40,722
And what does that mean?

It's a bombing run!

They're attacking the Titans from
the sky where they can't hit back!

humankind on one huge air raid!

687
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:52,622
It's an air raid?

688
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:55,482
Then maybe there's still hope.

689
00:50:56,542 --> 00:51:01,142
Attention! All airship units and
soldiers stationed at Fort Salter.

690
00:51:02,512 --> 00:51:06,322
This is where we make our final stand.
The last bastion of mankind.

691
00:51:08,822 --> 00:51:12,502
The immeasurable weight of
this moment now falls upon you.

692
00:51:13,442 --> 00:51:18,782
But in victory or in defeat, the
burden is not rightfully yours to bear.

693
00:51:21,422 --> 00:51:25,922
That responsibility lies with
those of us who came before you.

694
00:51:27,422 --> 00:51:30,502
We cultivated hate.
Nurtured our resentments.

695
00:51:30,526 --> 00:51:33,562
We let ourselves
believe that could save us.

696
00:51:34,242 --> 00:51:39,062
And what came of our failings, we
simply dumped onto the "island of devils."

697
00:51:40,162 --> 00:51:41,542
This is the result.

698
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:45,299
Those failings gave rise
to the monster you see.

699
00:51:45,323 --> 00:51:49,522
And it's marching our hatred back upon us.

700
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:56,562
So if, somehow, we can
secure a future for our world,

701
00:51:57,202 --> 00:51:59,782
I vow to never repeat those same mistakes.

702
00:52:00,682 --> 00:52:02,242
So help me, God.

703
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:33,419
Miss Barina! [Leonhart] Karina.

704
00:52:34,422 --> 00:52:40,242
All these years, when I looked at my
little boy, I just saw a tool for revenge.

705
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:45,362
So how could I call myself a mother?

706
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:48,882
We're the same.

707
00:52:50,522 --> 00:52:52,902
I hope you will make that vow with me.

708
00:52:53,902 --> 00:52:56,722
To break away from this era of mutual hate.

709
00:52:57,682 --> 00:53:00,002
Continuing approach.
Airships are in formation.

710
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:03,362
Preparing for bombardment.
Descending to altitude.

711
00:53:04,622 --> 00:53:08,259
To build a new world of
mutual care and understanding.

712
00:53:08,283 --> 00:53:13,402
And let today be our last
goodbye to our own monsters.

[MARLEYAN SOLDIER B gasps]

714
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,072
The attack Titan is making a move!

715
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:25,592
Commence bombardment!

716
00:53:27,312 --> 00:53:28,312
Bombs away!

717
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:52,072
They're too high!
The bombs aren't landing on targets!

718
00:53:52,452 --> 00:53:56,012
This is our only chance.
All units release payloads immediately!

720

[MARLEYAN SOLIDER A]
All airship units have been lost.

721
00:54:59,592 --> 00:55:00,692
No survivors.

722
00:55:06,352 --> 00:55:07,592
Forgive us, children.

723
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:12,320
[MULLER] We've failed you again.

724
00:55:12,652 --> 00:55:15,012
Mommy, they're coming.

725
00:55:16,222 --> 00:55:17,952
The Titan started slowing down.

726
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,732
I'm scared.

727
00:55:20,252 --> 00:55:22,352
I'm so sorry.

728
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:29,972
I'm sure that Annie and
Reiner are still alive on Paradis.

729
00:55:32,112 --> 00:55:33,112
Yes.

What's that?

732
00:55:47,342 --> 00:55:49,222
In the clouds.

733
00:55:56,702 --> 00:55:59,242
Damn it! They're nearly dry!

734

Target sighted! Prepare to jump!

735
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:12,432
What about you? Hurry up and get over here!

736
00:56:12,512 --> 00:56:15,432
I'm staying! We're going to
drop you straight onto the target!

737
00:56:16,932 --> 00:56:19,332
Let me worry about
getting this thing back down.

738
00:56:19,732 --> 00:56:22,332
Don't jump till you're damn
sure you'll land on the founder!

Furry shit bag. The Beast is in the field!

742
00:56:35,032 --> 00:56:37,532
Good! Then we don't have to look for it!

743
00:56:37,972 --> 00:56:40,652
You know the plan!
The Beast Titan is priority one!

744
00:56:40,677 --> 00:56:42,977
Destroying him could
end this battle in one shot!

745

and the Cart Titan's there too!

758

All those soldiers are wearing ODM gear.
It's them.

You said there was nothing
to say, but you were wrong.

I've got a question,
and you will answer it.

What do you really mean
when you say you're free?
